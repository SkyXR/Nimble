# RapidJS

A minimal rapid prototyping framework for javascript development.

## Concept

* Fast live-reloading: the basis of any rapid prototyping framework
* Unopinionated: doesn't force you to use React, Vue, Angular, etc. 
* Open-Source: obviously. And with actual docs.

## Usage

* Install npm (or pnpm, or yarn).
* git clone this repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm go`

This starts a live-reload environment based off the web server, Budo.
Any time you change app.js the web browser will reload automagically.
